## Observations

From 2006 to 2012, **Innovative products at Facebook have greatly outperformed their clone counterparts**. Innovative products performed approximately 66% better than cloned products. Likes, Timeline, Open Graph have all been long-lived and successful. Marketplace, Places, and Deals have suffered (current data suggests Poke will have the same fate). **From 2006 to 2012, Facebook never launched a clone that has not been discontinued.**

But not all innovative products are successful, Beacon and Credits both met an unfortunate end. Data suggests Facebook Home will head to the wayside as well.

As we watch Facebook unveil it's latest Vine clone, data suggests that this product will be a flop.
