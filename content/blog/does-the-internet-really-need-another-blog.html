After going back and forth for the last couple of months, I've decided to start writing again. One of the main points I wrestled with was, does the internet need another blog? What value can I add? What will readers gain from my perspective? I have decided that this is a narrow view.

## Writing as Personal Eminence

At my current employer, we are heavily encouraged to assist in the creation of "eminence" materials for the company. These documents range from whitepapers to POVs to internal educational materials. After I leave, all of my eminence will be tied to these documents, and thus the firm. Writing provides a means to develop personal eminence for ideas and thing I find interesting. This eminence will stay with me regardless of where and how I create it.

## Writing as Building Focus

Unquestionably, writing helps you learn what you are doing. Writing down the steps I've taken to create something helps me better understand what I have actually been doing. From a technical standpoint, documenting the steps taken to produce a given result helps recreate that result in the future, and better understand the inner workings of your finished product.

## Writing as Personal Growth

Writing helps document and visualize your thought process over a long period of time. At the macro level, trends can be observed that would go unnoticed at the day-to-day level. Writing helps shake out the noise, and see the bigger picture in your development as a person.

## Writing isn't just for Education

Even if you have no readers, one can realize the above benefits. But, if you have the opportunity to expose your writing to others, you have an opportunity to help give back to the community we are all a part of.
