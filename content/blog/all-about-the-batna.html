Next month Apple will go to trial against the US Government. The case that alleges Apple was the leader of a price-fixing racket for ebooks. The US recently [released emails between Apple and HarperCollins][1] that outside of the obvious legal implications show Steve Jobs' ability to negotiate under pressure and bridge a deal with one of America's largest publishers.

## Friday January 22, 2010

Apple was preparing to launch the iPad in just 5 days. By this time, Apple had already signed two major publishers to provide content for the iPad on iTunes, Penguin and Simon & Schuster. At the end of the day *Brian Murray* (CEO of HarperCollins) sends an email to *Eddy Cue* (Head of iTunes and App Store) with his first terms between the two juggernauts:

>Eddy,
>
>Thanks for coming in again this morning. We’ve talked over the proposal and I want to make sure that you have a summary of the deal that HarperCollins would be willing to do in your timeframe.
>
>1. Pricing: We need flexibility to price on a title by title basis outside the prescribed tiers in the contract. We will use our best efforts to meet the tiers we discussed.
>
>2. MFN ["most favored nation" status]: In the event that HarperCollins and Apple disagree on a consumer price for a title, HarperCollins needs the ability to make that title available through other agents who support the higher price.
>
>3. Commissions: We need a lower commission on new releases for the economics to work for us and our authors. We believe a 30% commission will lead to more authors asking for ebooks to be delayed a result that will not work for Apple or HarperCollins.
>
>4. The new release window: We need to have flexibility on the agency window. We believe this window should be 6 months rather than 12 months in the event that one or more large retailers do not move to an agency model.
>
>Leslie will be sending Kevin a contract that reflects these points in the event you wish to move forward on these terms.
>
>Thanks
>
>Brian

The deals Apple had previously signed would allow Apple and publishers to to price ebooks at $12.99, and let Apple take home roughly 30% of sales. HarperCollins wanted the freedom to set its own prices and didn't want to give up 30%. *James Murdoch*, a senior executive at News Corp forwarded the exchange to Steve with the following note:

>Steve,
>
>Thanks for your call earlier today, and for the time last week.
>
>I spoke to Brian Murray and Jon Miller [News Corp's head of digital media]—and Brian is sending a note to Eddy today. I thin I have a handle on this now. In short—we we would like to be able to get something done with Apple—but there are legitimate concerns.
>
>The economics are simple enough. [Amazon] Kindle pays us a wholesale price of $13 and sells it for 9.99. An author gets $4.20 on the sale of a hardcover and $3.30 on the sale of the e-book on the Kindle.
>
>[redacted]
>
>Basically—the entire hypothetical benefit of a book without raw materials and distribution cost accrues to Apple, not to the publisher or to the creator of the work.
>
>The other big issue is one of holdbacks. If we can’t agree on the fair price for a book, your team’s proposal restricts us from making that book available elsewhere, even at a higher price. This is just a bridge too far for us.
>
>Also, we are worried about setting prices to high—lots of ebooks are $9.99. A new release window with a lower commission (say 10[%]) for the first six months would enable us to proce much more kenly for Apple customers. We’d like to da that.
>
>More on this below in Brian’s note to Eddy. We outline a deal we can do.
>
>Feel free to call or write anytime over the weekend to discuss if you like.
>
>I am in the UK (so eight hours ahead of CA). My home number is [redacted]. I check the email regularly.
>
>Steve, make no mistake that across the board (TV, Studios, Books, and Newspapers) we would much rather be working with apple than not. But we, and our partners who produce, write, edit, and otherwise make all this with us, have views on fair pricing, and care a lot about our future flexibility. I hope we can figure out a way, if not now and in time for this launch of yours, then maybe in the future.
>
>Best,
>
>JRM

The groundworks for the negotiation had been laid. HarperCollins laid out the following terms it disagreed with:

1. **Benefit**: HarperCollins believes that the benefit of having an ebook (lack of materials and distribution cost) accrues disproportionately to Apple, and does not benefit the publishor or creator enough
2. **Lock-in**: Apple's proposal does not allow HarperCollins to sell it's books elsewhere, even at a higher price
3. **Pricing**: HarperCollins thinks $12.99 is too expensive for ebooks, quoting lots of ebooks being sold at $9.99

In typical Jobs fashion, Steve was unwilling to compromise.

>James,
>
>A few thoughts to consider (I’d appreciate it if we can keep this between you and me):
>
>1. The current business model of companies like Amazon distributing ebooks below cost or without making a reasonable profit isn’t sustainable for long. As ebooks become a larger business, distributors will need to make at least a small profit, and you will want this too so that they invest in the future of the business with infrastructure, marketing, etc.
>
>2. All the major publishers tell us that Amazon’s $9.99 price for new releases is eroding the value perception of their products in customer’s minds, and they do not want this practice to continue for new releases.
>
>3. Apple is proposing to give the cost benefits of a book without raw materials, distribution, remaindering, cost of capital, bad debt, etc., to the customer, not Apple. This is why a new release would be priced at $12.99, say, instead of $16.99 or even higher. Apple doesn’t want to make more than the slim profit margin it makes distributing music, movies, etc.
>
>4. $9 per new release should represent a gross margin neutral business model for the publishers. We are not asking them to make any less money. As for the artists, giving them the same amount of royalty as they make today, leaving the publisher with the same profits, is as easy as sending them all a letter telling them that you are paying them a higher percentage for ebooks. They won’t be sad.
>
>5. Analysts estimate that Amazon has sold more than one million Kindles in 18+ months (Amazon has never said). We will sell more of our new devices than all of the Kindles ever sold during the first few weeks they are on sale. If you stick with just Amazon, Sony, etc., you will likely be sitting on the sidelines of the mainstream ebook revolution.
>
>6. Customers will demand an end-to-end solution, meaning an online bookstore that carries the books, handles the transactions with their credit cards, and delivers the books seamlessly to their device. So far, there are only two companies who have demonstrated online stores with significant transaction volume—Apple and Amazon. Apple’s iTunes Store and App Store have over 120 million customers with credit cards on file and have downloaded over 12 billion products. This is the type of online assets that will be required to scale the ebook business into something that matters to the publishers.
>
>So, yes, getting around $9 per new release is less than the $12.50 or so that Amazon is currently paying. But the current situation is not sustainable and not a strong foundation upon which to build an ebook business.
>
>[redacted]
>
>Apple is the only other company currently capable of making a serious impact, and we have 4 of the 6 big publishers signed up already. Once we open things up for the second tier of publishers, we will have plenty of books to offer. We’d love to have HC among them.
>
>Thanks for listening.
>
>Steve

## The Negotiation

The very same day Jobs sends a response and addresses each of Murdoch's points:

1. **Benefit**: Steve points out that the cost benefit of an ebook benefits the customer, not Apple. This is why, he explains, they are charging $12.99 as opposed to $16.99 or higher. He claims apple is happy with the "slim profit margin" it currently makes
2. **Pricing**: Apple's existing deals with publishers has informed them that the current low-cost of ebooks may be eroding the value of ebooks percieved by consumers
3. **Lock-in**: $9 per book should be a gross margin netrual model for publishers and artists. At $13, he argues they will make the same amount of profit as before (or more)

This problem is a common one during negotiation. Both parties appear to be at opposites of the negotiation, with no way to compromise that leaves both parties satisfied. A skillful negotiator will see this as an opportunity to "expand the pie", or invent new options for both parties to consider. This is an excerpt taken from [Getting to Yes][2] which is a fantastic book on negotiation from Roger Fisher and William Ury of the Harvard Program on Negotiation:

>As valuable as it is to have many options, people involved in a negotiation rarely sense a need for them. In a dispute, people usually believe that they know the right answer—their view should prevail. In a contract negotiation they are equally likely to believe that their offer is reasonable and should be adopted, perhaps with some adjustment in the price. All available answers appear to lie along a straight line between their position and yours. Often the only creative thinking shown is to suggest splitting the difference.
>
>In most negotiations there are four major obstacles that inhibit the inventing of an abundance of options: (1) premature judgment; (2) searching for the single answer; (3) the assumption of a fixed pie; and (4) thinking that “solving their problem is their problem.” In order to overcome these constraints, you need to understand them.

Look at the additional points Jobs brings into the negotiation:

1. **Sustainability**: Jobs is quick to make a case that as ebooks grow larger Amazon's lower-cost business model will fall apart
2. **Exposure**: The Kindle has sold 1m units in ~18 months, and analysts expect the iPad to sell more than that in it's first week. "If you stick with just Amazon, Sony, etc., you will likely be sitting on the sidelines"
3. **Quality**: iTunes has 120m users on file, and is one of the only players that can produce a solution that will meet the needs of consumers
4. **Competition**: Jobs casually slips this one in at the end of his message: "We have 4 of the 6 big publishers signed up already"

Not only does Jobs address Murdoch's points head-on, but he expands the pie by giving him more options to think about.

At this point, Murdoch starts to cave.

>Steve,
>
>I think the crux of this is our flexibility to offer product elsewhere at price-points you don’t like.
>
>If we could offer to you that a certain percentage of releases (>50%) would be available within your pricing structure (< or = 14.99), does that give you enough comfort?
>
>I think we are worried more about the absolute holdback of product elsewhere, and our ceding of pricing to Apple, than we are about the actual haggle over what the price will be.
>
>I haven’t shared this with HC directly—so this is only hypothetical. But if you were willing to accept that a supplier can exploit other avenues (at prices not disadvantageous to you), with a guarantee of substantial volume through Apple—maybe I could work with HC to get to some common ground.
>
>Please let me know.
>
>A different question: we have four areas of discussion (related to our product) between our teams right now: Books, US Video, Int’l Video, and newspapers. All at different stages of maturity, these discussions are all centered, for us, around the desire to make our product widely available, and to make yours and our products more attractive for our customers. It seems though that we in each one we largely encounter a “take it or leave it” set of terms, and predictably we’ve so far failed to really strike the kind of partnerships that could move things forward.
>
>Is it worth considering in the round, over the next few months or weeks, whether or not some of these loose ends can be tidied up? It’s clear that Apple is already becoming an attractive platform for so many of our customers—all over the world. As a creative company at our core, NWS [News Corp.] should be more engaged with Apple, and I think Apple could be more engaged with NWS, globally, than either of us are today.
>
>Best,
>
>JRM

With Murdoch bending, Jobs sees the opportunity and sends his last message outlining the options for Murdoch.

>James,
>
>Our proposal does set the upper limit for ebook retail pricing based on the hardcover price of each book. The reason we are doing this is that, with our experience selling a lot of content online, we simply don’t think the ebook market can be successful with pricing higher than $12.99 or $14.99. Heck, Amazon is selling these books at $9.99, and who knows, maybe they are right and we will fail even at $12.99. But we’re willing to try at the prices we’ve proposed. We are not willing to try at higher prices because we are pretty sure we’ll all fail.
>
>As I see it, HC has the following choices:
>
>1. Throw in with Apple and see if we can all make a go of this to create a real mainstream ebooks market at $12.99 and $14.99.
>
>2. Keep going with Amazon at $9.99. You will make a bit more money in the short term, but in the medium term Amazon will tell you they will be paying you 70% of $9.99. They have shareholders too.
>
>3. Hold back your books from Amazon. Without a way for customers to buy your ebooks, they will steal them. This will be the start of piracy and once started there will be no stopping it. Trust me, I’ve seen this happen with my own eyes.
>
>Maybe I’m missing something, but I don’t see any other alternatives. Do you?
>
>Regards,
>
>Steve

In negotiations, it is common to reference a **BATNA**, or "Best Alternative to a Negotiated Agreement." Essentially, what happens if you need to walk away from the table. *Getting to Yes* has this to say on the subject:

>The reason you negotiate is to produce something better than the results you can obtain without negotiating. What are those results? What is that alternative? What is your BATNA—your Best Alternative To a Negotiated Agreement? That is the standard against which any proposed agreement should be measured. That is the only standard which can protect you both from accepting terms that are too unfavorable and from rejecting terms it would be in your interest to accept.

A BATNA is commonly used as a measure to help you ground yourself in negotiation. But the true power of a BATNA is when it is used as leverage. From *Getting to Yes*:

>People think of negotiating power as being determined by resources like wealth, political connections, physical strength, friends, and military might. In fact, the relative negotiating power of two parties depends primarily upon how attractive to each is the option of not reaching agreement...Think for a moment about how you would feel walking into a job interview with no other job offers—only some uncertain leads. Think how the talk about salary would go. Now contrast that with how you would feel walking in with two other job offers. How would that salary negotiation proceed? The difference is power.

Jobs has a strong BATNA, and HarperCollins has a weak BATNA. Jobs has an incredible product, a great platform for distribution, an attractive business model, and all of HarperCollins's competitors already chomping at the bit. He uses this BATNA as leverage and to ultimately close the deal with HarperCollins.

Two days later, the day before the announcement, HarperCollins agrees to Apple's terms. They launch in the Apple Bookstore and the rest of the story, is history.

## Lessons Learned

 - **Invent Options for Mutual Gain**: Don't bargin on position. Expand your options for the greatest success
 - **BATNA is Leverage**: A strong BATNA is not just a safety net, but a tool for leverage against your opponent. Treat it like so, and develop your BATNA accordingly prior to entering negotiations

Written by Roger Fisher and William L. Ury of the Harvard Negotiation Project, [Getting to Yes][2] is one of the leading books on this subject. If you found this interesting, give it a read!
