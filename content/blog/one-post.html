To complete the character-study of Mr. Worple, he was a man of extremely
uncertain temper, and his general tendency was to think that Corky was a poor
chump and that whatever step he took in any direction on his own account, was
just another proof of his innate idiocy. I should imagine Jeeves feels very
much the same about me.

So when Corky trickled into my apartment one afternoon, shooing a girl in
front of him, and said, "Bertie, I want you to meet my fianc√©e, Miss Singer,"
the aspect of the matter which hit me first was precisely the one which he had
come to consult me about. The very first words I spoke were, "Corky, how about
your uncle?"

The poor chap gave one of those mirthless laughs. He was looking anxious and
worried, like a man who has done the murder all right but can't think what the
deuce to do with the body.
